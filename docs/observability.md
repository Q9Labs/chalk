# Production observability

API request logs and Sync event spans export to Axiom. The local Grafana stack,
journey ledger, client telemetry, Episode diagnostics and trace CLI are removed.

## Follow an incident

Start with the Space and Episode IDs from the affected class and the participant
ID when available. Keep the server error code and trace/request ID from a
failed join when locating the corresponding request.
Not every request has an Episode (for example, authentication before joining).

In the relevant Axiom API log or Sync trace dataset, run:

```apl
| search "<episode-id>"
```

Replace the placeholder with the affected Episode ID. Narrow by Tenant, Space,
participant or trace ID where those attributes are present. API/Sync exporters
remain enabled through their managed OTLP configuration; dataset names and tokens
are private deployment inputs, not repository constants.

## Alerts

Three Axiom monitors cover API errors and abnormal Sync drops, failed/overdue
recordings and transcripts or exhausted webhooks, and stale collector state.
The read-only collector and Discord message templates live in
[infrastructure/observability/production-alerts](../infrastructure/observability/production-alerts/README.md).
An independent uptime Worker checks API/Sync health and readiness and reports
failures directly to Discord. No public status projection is maintained.
