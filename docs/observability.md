# Production observability

API request logs and Sync event spans export to Axiom. Use W3C trace IDs and
Space or Episode IDs to correlate them. The private
`observability_journey_events` table holds the durable correlation record for
webhook and recording lifecycles.

## Follow an incident

Start with the Space and Episode IDs from the affected class and the participant
ID when available. Keep the server error code and trace/request ID from a
failed join when locating the corresponding request.
Tenant-level requests do not have an Episode ID.

In the relevant Axiom API log or Sync trace dataset, run:

```apl
| search "<episode-id>"
```

Replace the placeholder with the affected Episode ID. Narrow by Tenant, Space,
participant or trace ID where those attributes are present. API/Sync exporters
remain enabled through their managed OTLP configuration; dataset names and tokens
are private deployment inputs, not repository constants.

When a Participant joined without a knock, check the journey root named
`participant.admission_requested` in `observability_journey_events`. A backend
that asked for direct admission leaves `"admission": "direct"` in its
attributes. Policy admissions carry no `admission` attribute.

## Alerts

Three Axiom monitors cover API errors and abnormal Sync drops, failed/overdue
recordings and transcripts or exhausted webhooks, and stale collector state.
The read-only collector and Discord message templates live in
[infrastructure/observability/production-alerts](../infrastructure/observability/production-alerts/README.md).
An independent uptime Worker checks API/Sync health and readiness and reports
failures directly to Discord.

### Sync lifecycle readiness evidence

When `/readyz` reports `lifecycle_intent_lag`, its cached dependency snapshot
retains the database observations from that failed probe. `database.lifecycle_intents`
reports pending, due, and retrying counts, plus the oldest pending intent's attempt
count and allowlisted error code (`other` for unknown codes; `null` before a failure).
The oldest pending age includes scheduled retries, not only work currently due.
Use these fields to distinguish undiscovered backlog from repeated delivery failures;
they do not establish the underlying cause of a `dependency_unavailable` result.
The response contains no intent, Episode, participant, or Tenant identifiers.
Readiness thresholds, retry scheduling, and the one-second query timeout are unchanged.

### Sync connection failures

`sync.websocket.handshake` records `client_ip` (the edge's `CF-Connecting-IP`,
validated as an IP, or the direct peer) and a `user_agent` bounded to 512 characters.
The edge must replace the IP header before forwarding requests to Sync.
`sync.websocket.authenticated` adds verified `tenant_id`, `participant_id`, and
`episode_id`; close events retain those fields even if recovery fails after hello.
These lifecycle events include their structured fields in stdout as well as spans.
`close_code` is null until a server close is selected. Bandit does not expose the
peer's close frame to WebSock; peer codes remain null rather than guessed.
No token, authorization header, or request URL is retained.

The client retains `stage`, `opened`, `closeCode`, `closeReason`, and `durationMs`
in `failure.sync` and connection diagnostics. The failure reference shows the same
short summary. Before `open`, `stage=upgrade` means the opening handshake is pending;
browser WebSocket APIs do not reveal DNS, TCP, or TLS progress. After `open`, the
startup stage is `hello` (including initial recovery). Unknown peer reasons become
`redacted`; only fixed protocol reasons are retained. The codes are
`connection.sync_websocket_failed`, `connection.sync_dial_timeout`, and the existing
`connection.sync_hello_timeout`. Retries can still succeed within the startup budget.
